# Risk-Neutral Probability Measure

## 1. Theory
The central concept required for our analysis is the martingale. The precise definition is the following:

**Definition 1 (Martingale).**  
A stochastic process $\\{M(t)\\}\_{t \ge 0}$ is called a martingale with respect to the filtration $\\{\mathcal{F}(t)\\}\_{t \ge 0}$ if it is adapted to $\\{\mathcal{F}(t)\\}_{t \ge 0}$, $M(t)\in L^1(\Omega)$ for all $t\ge 0$, and

$$
\mathbb{E}[M(t)\mid \mathcal{F}_s] = M(s), \qquad 0 \le s \le t, \qquad (1.0)
$$

for all $t \ge 0$.
